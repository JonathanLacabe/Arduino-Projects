These are programs in which a breadboard configuration of LEDs is used to convey music. See the video for the "alsosprach" and try out the program for yourself as an example of what these programs entail.


Coloring guide for more complex programs:
The different sections of instruments (woodwinds, strings, etc.) will have their own signifying colors in order to differentiate them on the breadboard and for aesthetic purposes. Some general synesthesia-based colorings for instrumentation are as follows:

Woodwinds: Green.
Brass: Orange-Red.
Strings: Blue.
Percussion: Every. (Timpani is Red, Glockenspiel is yellow/pink, gong and cymbals are white, with the rest of the bunch being individual as well.)
Keyboards (organ, piano, celesta): Pink, Purple.

The different instruments of each section are represented as well through different shades of the colors that their section has been designated, oftentime with the higher pitched instruments (like the piccolo) having lighter colors and the lower pitched instruments (like the tuba) being darker. The string section allow follows this pattern, with the shades of blue being darker as afforded by the pitch of each instrument, darkening in the same way the instruments descend in a score.

In light shows that feature solo instruments, some sort of accommodation should also be made, such as a unique shade of the section color and some separation from the other instruments on the breadboard score. 

The general feeling of the music may also be cause for an aberation from the coloring guide as written, such as the flutes in the storm sequence of "An Alpine Symphony", which I would personally represent as dark blue to match the heavy use of strings in the passage and the general feeling of rain. These are my personal feelings on how to color the instruments in musical light-shows.

Orchestral techniques such as flutter-tonguing can be represented through blinking/changing the brightness of the LED very quickly using the analogWrite tool. The dynamics of a score should also be represented through the analog brightness, preferably using a capacitor, with the color also being changed accordingly. For example, during a crescendo a brass instrument can get redder and brighter, utilizing the rgb capabilities of the LEDs.
